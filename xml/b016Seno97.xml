          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

        <note type="footnote">Cf. INOKUCHI 1989, p.39. Regarding its place of discovery, Klaus WILLE of the University of Göttingen has kindly directed my attention to the label "DA cour," i.e. Duldur-āqur. It is written in Northem Turkestan Brāhmī, type a. The first transcription of the whole fragment and the identification of its parts as the Udānavarga were made by Jens-Uwe HARTMANN on the basis of its microfilm preserved in the Seminar für Indologie und Buddhismuskunde, University of Göttingen. I do not give lines 6-8 on recto and seven lines on verso, since they are written by other scribes and do not correspond to SĀc 1077.</note>
