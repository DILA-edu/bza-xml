          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

        <p>Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park. At that time, when the hour to go on almsround had come, a number of monks took their robes and begging bowls and entered the town to beg for food. There the monks heard that the monk ‘Elephant-head’ , a member of the Sakyā clan, had fallen ill in the town and died. Having finished their meals they returned, went to the Buddha, paid homage to his feet and sat to one side. They told the Buddha: ‘World-honored One, this morning we took our robes and begging bowls and entered the town to beg for food. There we heard that the monk ‘Elephant-head’ had died. We now wish the World-honored One would explain to us where the monk ‘Elephant-head’ will be reborn, what karmic fruit he will obtain?’.</p>
        <p>The Buddha said to the monks: ‘Those that cause to increase the three negative factors, must, after the body fails and life comes to an end, fall into hell. What are the three negative factors? They are known as the increase of greed, of ignorance and of hate. Now this monk has committed the increase of the three negative factors. Understand, you monks, that he will fall into hell’.</p>
        <p>At that time the Buddha spoke this verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>If one gives rise to an unwholesome mind / effecting greed, ignorance and anger,//</l>
          <l>does evil with one’s body / one will harm oneself,//</l>
          <l>like the banana plant when bearing fruit / harms its own body//</l>
          <l>The absence of greed, anger and ignorance / is called wisdom.//</l>
          <l>Those who do not harm their own bodies / are called victors.//</l>
          <l>By this one should cut off / the great suffering of greed, anger, and ignorance.//</l>
        </lg>
        <p>There the monks, having listened to what the Buddha had said, were happy and practised accordingly.</p>
