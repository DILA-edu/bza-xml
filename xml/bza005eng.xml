          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in
                              the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time the elder Nanda was [always] wearing new and spotless robes and
                              carrying the best alms bowls. He gave himself airs and with an arrogant attitude
                              thought himself superior to others. Trying to advance himself, he was saying
                              haughtily: ‘I am a younger brother of the Buddha, the son of his maternal aunt’.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thereupon a number of monks went to the Buddha, paid homage to his feet, sat to
                              one side and said to the Buddha: ‘World-honored One! The monk Nanda is always
                              wearing new and spotless robes, is carrying the best bowls, and calls himself
                              ‘younger brother of the Buddha’, saying he is ‘the son of the maternal aunt’, he
                              is giving himself airs and treats others haughtily’. When the Buddha heard this,
                              he send a monk to fetch Nanda. Having been ordered by the Buddha, the monk went
                              to Nanda and said to him: ‘The World-honored One calls you!’. When Nanda heard
                              this he went to the Buddha, paid homage to his feet and stood to one side. The
                              Buddha said to him: ‘Are you really wearing new and spotless robes, carrying the
                              best alms bowls, saying you are my younger brother, the son of my maternal aunt,
                              and behave haughtily towards others? Is this true?’. Nanda said: ‘It is true,
                              World-honored One!’. The Buddha said to him: ‘You shouldn’t do this. From now
                              on, enjoy living in the forest, among graves, under trees, in worn-out robes
                              begging for food. If you are my younger brother, born of my maternal aunt, you
                              should practise like this, work in this way’.
        </p>
        <p>At that time the World-honored One spoke a verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>When will I see / Nanda enjoying the practice of ascetics,//</l>
          <l>Living like them in forests / sitting between graves begging for food,//</l>
          <l>
            in mountains and forests resting at silent places / letting go of desire,
                                    entering meditation?//
          </l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          When the Buddha finished this verse, the monks, having listened to what he had
                              said, were happy and practised accordingly.
