          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

        <p>Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
        <p>At that time there was a monk named Tissa, who was the son of the Buddha’s paternal aunt. Relying on his kinship with the Buddha, he often harbored arrogance, did not respect the elder and virtuous monks, behaved without conscience and shame. He often talked a lot, but when the other monks said little in return, he became angry. Some monks having observed this a few times, went to the Buddha, with folded hands paid homage to his feet and sat to one side. They told the Buddha: ‘World-honored One! Tissa often harbors arrogance, says of himself: “I am the son of the Buddha’s paternal aunt”. He thinks little of the elder monks. He often talks a lot and when the other monks say little in return, he becomes angry’. The Buddha told the monks: ‘Go now and call monk Tissa’. Having received this order from the Buddha they went and summoned Tissa. When he received the summons, he went to the Buddha, and having paid homage to his feet, sat to one side. The Tathāgata then said to Tissa: ‘Is it true that when meeting the elder monks, your mind is without respect, without conscience and shame? Is it true that you are talking a lot and when the other monks say little in return, you become angry?’. Tissa answered: ‘It is true, World-honored One!’. The Buddha told Tissa: ‘Especially since you are the son of my paternal aunt, you should generate deep respect towards the venerable and virtuous elders and all monks, your demeanor should be conscientious and with a sense of shame. You should speak less, listen to what others say, and be tolerant’.</p>
        <p>At that time the Buddha spoke a verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>Always practise the good, never generate anger / whatever generates anger cannot be called good.//</l>
          <l>Tissa, now that you are here with me / cut off your anger and arrogance;//</l>
          <l>practise all that is good and live a pure and chaste life / I am happy for those who do so.//</l>
        </lg>
        <p>When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and practised accordingly.</p>
