          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

        <p>Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
        <p>It happened that at that time a great number of monks had gathered in the Dhamma hall, and all were making robes. At that time there was one young monk , who had but recently gone forth, had just received the precepts. He sat among the monks, but was not making robes. The monks, once finished with the robes, went to the Buddha, paid homage to his feet and sat to one side. They told the Buddha: ‘World-honored One! We monks were sitting in the Dhamma hall, stitching our robes and this young monk sat between us, not doing anything to make robes for the community’. The Buddha said to the young monk: ‘Is it true that you didn’t help with the robes?’. The monk answered the Buddha: ‘World-honored One! I too was striving to do my part of the monks’ work’. The World-honored One knew what the monk thought and told the other monks: ‘You should not reprimand this young monk for not working. This monk has done what is to be done, attained Arahatship, ended all defilements, cast off the heavy burden, found right knowledge, his mind is liberated’.</p>
        <p>At that time the Buddha spoke a verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>This nirvanic truth of mine / is not something those//</l>
          <l>lazy and without knowledge / can attain.//</l>
          <l>Like a good horse / the best [practitioner]//</l>
          <l>breaks the fetter of attachment / ends all defilements,//</l>
          <l>gives up the four clingings / attains Nirvāṇa,//</l>
          <l>can defeat Māra’s armies / wears the final body.//</l>
        </lg>
        <p>When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and practised accordingly.</p>
