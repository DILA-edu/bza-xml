          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

        <p>Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
        <p>At that time the elder  Saṅgāmaji was coming to Sāvatthī from Kosalā and went to the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park. At that time Saṅgāmaji’s former wife learned that he had come to Sāvatthī. She got dressed, put on her jewelery, took their son with her and went to Saṅgāmaji’s place. When Saṅgāmaji came out to walk about  in the open, she approached him and said: ‘Our son is too small to sustain himself, therefore I have come to see the venerable’. Although he saw her, he did not speak with her. She addressed him a second and a third time, but though the Venerable Saṅgāmaji stood facing her, he did not look at her nor speak. His former wife then said to him: ‘I came to see you, but you will not speak with me. Here is your son, raise him yourself’, put the son in the way of his father, left him there and went back. In the distance she stopped and looked back. The Venerable did not speak to his son. There the former wife thought by herself: ‘This renunciant has well attained liberation, was able to cut off the fetter of attachment. The cutting off, which the seer [the Buddha, has accomplished], he too has attained completely’. Her wish unfulfilled, she went back, took the child, and carried it back home.</p>
        <p>At that time the World-honored One, his pure divine hearing far better than human hearing, listened to what Saṅgāmaji’s former wife had said and spoke this verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>To see coming and not rejoicing / to see leaving and not being sad, //</l>
          <l>one who has cut off all attachment and desire/ is the very best brāhmaṇa. //</l>
          <l>Coming, one does not rejoice / leaving, one is not sad, //</l>
          <l>getting rid of defilements, practicing in purity / this called a wise brāhmaṇa. //</l>
        </lg>
        <p>When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and practised accordingly.</p>
