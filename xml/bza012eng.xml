          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

        <p>Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying in Rājagaha on the mountain Isigili.</p>
        <p>At that time the Venerable Ānanda was resting, when, quietly, this thought arose in him: ‘Once the World-honored One spoke about three kinds of scent: The scents of roots, stalks and blossoms, and that there are no better scents than these. However [he said] these three can [only] be sensed  when the wind is right, and can not be sensed against the wind’. Having thought like this, Ānanda rose from his seat, went to the Buddha, and having paid  homage to his feet sat to one side. He said to the Buddha: ‘World-honored One! Just now, while I was resting, quietly, this thought arose in me: “Once the World-honored One has spoken about three kinds of scent: The scents of roots, stalks and blossoms, and that these are the best among all scents. However [, he said, ] these could [only] be sensed with the wind and not against the wind”. World-honored One, is there a scent that can be sensed both with and against the wind?’.</p>
        <p>The Buddha said to Ānanda: ‘Yes, of course there is. In this world there is a good scent that can be sensed both with and against the wind. And what scent? If there in a village or a town a man or a woman  practises restraint, does not kill, not steal, not commit sexual misconduct, does not lie, and not drink alcohol, then all devas and all those having attained divine sight will praise this person. Thus, if in a town or village a man or a woman keeps the five precepts, the scent of the precepts is sensed with and against the wind’.</p>
        <p>At that time the Buddha spoke this verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>Sandal and aloewood / roots, stalks and blossoms: //</l>
          <l>these scents are sensed with the wind / no one senses them against the wind. //</l>
          <l>The great man keeping the precepts / his fragrance pervades the world, //</l>
          <l>his fame fills the ten directions / it is sensed both with and against the wind. //</l>
          <l>Sandal and aloe wood / the water lily  and jasmine;  //</l>
          <l>these scents are inferior / unlike the scent of the precepts. //</l>
          <l>Those scents / do not reach far; //</l>
          <l>the scent of the precepts however reaches everywhere / better even than the heavenly scents. //</l>
          <l>One who takes the pure precepts / untiringly as the basis of his life //</l>
          <l>abides peacefully without defilements / by correct insight attains liberation. //</l>
          <l>Though the demons try to find him / they do not know his abode; //</l>
          <l>this is called the path of peacefully settling / this is the purest path, //</l>
          <l>forever leaving the many realms / giving up the samsaric worlds. //</l>
        </lg>
        <p>When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and practised accordingly.</p>
