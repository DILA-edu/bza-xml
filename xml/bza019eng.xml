          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

        <p>Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at the Deer Park [near] Benares, the dwelling-place of sages.</p>
        <p>At that time the World-honored One put on his robe, took his begging bowl and entered Benares [to beg for food]. There he saw a monk, whose mind  was not concentrated, his senses distracted. When this monk saw the Buddha coming from afar, he sunk his head in embarrassment. After the Buddha had finished his alms-round and washed his feet he entered dwelling-places of the monks and entered his silent abode. When he came out of his silent abode again, he sat among the monks and said to them: ‘This morning I saw a monk, whose had not reigned in his senses. When he saw me from afar, he became embarrassed, sunk his head and reigned in his sense-doors . Who was this?’. There the monk rose from his seat, arranged his his outer robe on his left shoulder, folded his palms together and said to the Buddha: ‘World-honored One! I was the one who was without concentration, whose senses were distracted’. The Buddha said: ‘Very good, oh monk! You were able to reign in your senses and focus your thought when you saw me. Whenever you see a monk, a nun, a lay-man or a lay-woman, you should do likewise. Control your senses and focus your thought, as if you would see me. This will bring you happiness and gain in the long night [of samsaric existance]’.</p>
        <p>There a monk spoke this verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>A monk went begging, entered the town / his mind distracted, confused and unstable; //</l>
          <l>when he sees the Buddha, with diligent effort he reigns in his senses / therefore the Buddha says ‘Very well’. //</l>
