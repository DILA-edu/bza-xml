          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

        <p>Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
        <p>At that time a monk took his robe and begging bowl and entered the town to beg for food. When he had eaten and returned, he washed his feet, gathered his seat cloth and went into the Forest of Regained Sight.  Beneath a tree after he had prepared the ground and started sitting, evil coarse and subtle thoughts arose [in his mind], greed for the five sensual pleasures. The spirit of the Forest of Regained Sight read the monks thoughts and saw that they were impure. [Since] in this forest one should not have evil inclinations, the spirit thought: ‘I will wake him up.’, and he said: ‘Monk, monk, why are you having an ulcer?’. The monk answered: ‘I will bandage my ulcer’. The forest spirit spoke again: ‘Your ulcer is large like a pot, how will you bandage it?’. The monk answered: ‘I will bandage my ulcer with [right] thought’. There the forest spirit said in praise: ‘Very good, very good! This monk knows well how to bandage his ulcer, how truly to bandage his ulcer’. The Buddha, with his divine hearing, heard the exchange between the forest spirit and the monk.</p>
        <p>At that time the World-honored One spoke this verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>Worldly desires / are born of evil thoughts. //</l>
          <l>Once an ulcer has grown / it nurtures a swarm of flies;  //</l>
          <l>desire is this ulcer / thought and reflection are the flies. //</l>
          <l>Because of greed, arrogance / pierces our heart. //</l>
          <l>Because of greed for fame and profit / we are caught in doubts, //</l>
          <l>do not know the escape / When the mind is trained and concentrated //</l>
          <l>one walks the way of the wise / one does not grow ulcers //</l>
          <l>but in peace and stability beholds the Buddha / and attains Nirvāṇa. //</l>
        </lg>
        <p>When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and practised accordingly.</p>
