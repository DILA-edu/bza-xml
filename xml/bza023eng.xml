          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying [north of] rājagaha in the
                              sītavana forest. at that time the Buddha told the monks: ‘human life is short,
                              it is bound to end. You should make an effort to follow the path and practise in
                              purity and celibacy. Therefore do not be lazy, and practise right conduct. You
                              should train yourselves in the [right] meaning of the Dhamma and true conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time the Demon King Māra, having heard what was said, thought: ‘The
                              renunciant gotama is expounding the principles of the Dhamma for his disciples
                              in the sītavana forest at rājagaha. I should go there and disturb them.’ Having
                              thought thus, he turned into a young man and went to the Buddha. He paid homage
                              at his feet and stood to one side. Then he spoke a verse:
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>Human life is long // without any cares or worries.</l>
          <l>[For those] always at ease // there is no path for death.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          The Buddha thought: ‘Māra the Bad has come to confuse and disturb us.’ And he
                              spoke this verse:
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>Human life hurries quickly away // filled with confusion and trouble;</l>
          <l>
            Make haste to practise the good // as if your head was on fire, and know the
                                    Bad One // has come to disturb.
          </l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          There King Māra, having heard the verse, thought: ‘The renunciant gotama knows my
                              intentions’. and he became depressed and dispirited and felt deep regret. he
                              made himself invisible and returned to his heavenly palace.
