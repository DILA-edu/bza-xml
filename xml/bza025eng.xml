          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying in Rājagaha in the Bamboo grove
                              of Jialantuo. At that time the Buddha spent the latter part of the night walking
                              about in the forest. In the morning, having washed his feet, he sat upright and
                              focused his attention in front of him. at that time King Māra had this thought:
                              ‘The renunciant gotama is in Rājagaha. During the latter part of the night he
                              walked about in the forest. In the morning, having washed his feet, he entered
                              his silent abode; he is [now] sitting upright and focusing his attention in
                              front of him. I should go and disturb him’. Having thought thus, he suddenly
                              turned into a young man, stood before the Buddha and spoke a verse:
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>My mind can weave // a net pervading every space;</l>
          <l>Renunciant, where I am // you never will be free.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>The Buddha thought: ‘Māra has come to disturb me’, and spoke a verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>The world holds five sensual pleasures // and the foolish are bound by them;</l>
          <l>If these desires can be cut // all suffering ends forever.</l>
          <l>I have cut off these desires // my mind is undefiled.</l>
          <l>The Bad One should know: // I tore apart desire’s net long ago.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          There, having heard this verse, King Māra, his wish unfulfilled,46 became
                              depressed and dispirited. He made himself invisible, left and returned to his
                              heavenly palace.
