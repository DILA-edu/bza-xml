          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on Gijjhakūṭa
                              Mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time, in the middle of the night, the World-honoured One walked in the
                              open. having washed his feet, he entered his silent abode, sat upright and
                              focused his attention in front of him. There, King Māra the Bad had this
                              thought: ‘The gotama renunciant [staying] in Rājagaha on Gijjhakūṭa Mountain is
                              walking in the open. I should go and disturb him’.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time King Māra changed into a huge snake that was long and thick like a
                              large boat. With a pair of eyes glittering brightly like a [bronze] bowl from
                              the land of Kosalā, tongue flickering in and out like lightning and breath
                              heaving like thunder, it stood before Buddha while coiling its body around him.
                              Then, it bent its neck forward, and lowered its head onto the head of the
                              Buddha. The Buddha, who knew that this was Māra [trying] to disturb him, spoke
                              this verse:
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>I live in complete solitude // the mind focused in true liberation,</l>
          <l>
            In quiet meditation and physical cultivation // according to the teaching of
                                    the former Buddhas.
          </l>
          <l>Poisonous snakes, fierce and violent // of terrifying appearance,</l>
          <l>constrictor snakes and vermin: // all these disturbances //</l>
          <l>cannot stir even one hair [on my body] // much less frighten me.</l>
          <l>If the sky broke apart // or the great earth shook,</l>
          <l>all beings // would feel great terror;</l>
          <l>[but] to frighten me // is not possible.</l>
          <l>Even if you aimed a poisoned arrow // at my heart,</l>
          <l>the moment the arrow struck // i would not seek protection;</l>
          <l>nevertheless the poisoned arrow // cannot penetrate.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          When King Māra heard the Buddha speak this verse he thought: ‘The gotama
                              renunciant knows my mind!’, and he became deeply afraid. Depressed and
                              dispirited, he made himself invisible and returned to his heavenly palace.
