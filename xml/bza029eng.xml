          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying near rājagaha in the Maddakucchi
                              Park.60 During the first watch of the night, the Buddha [practised while]
                              sitting in meditation and walking. When the first watch ended, he washed his
                              feet and entered his abode, laid down on his right side, one leg resting on the
                              other and, focusing his mind on clarity, directed his thoughts towards rising
                              [again after the rest].
        </p>
        <p>
          King Māra the Bad, understanding the Buddha’s mind, had this thought: ‘The
                              renunciant gotama is in rājagaha in the Maddakucchi Park. During the first watch
                              of the night, he [practised while] sitting in meditation and walking. When the
                              middle watch of the night began, he washed his feet, entered his abode, and laid
                              down on his right side, one leg resting on the other and, focusing his mind on
                              clarity, he directed his thoughts towards rising [again after the rest]. I
                              should now go and disturb him’.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon this, King Māra turned into a young man, [stood] in front of the Tathāgata
                              and spoke a verse:
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>Do you have nothing else to do // that you take a nap,</l>
          <l>peacefully slumbering, not waking up? // Passed out like a drunk,</l>
          <l>a person without wealth and property // how can he sleep untroubled?</l>
          <l>
            [Only] those with great wealth and property // pleased and happily do fall
                                    asleep.
          </l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          There the World-honoured One knew that Māra had come to disturb him and spoke
                              this verse:
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>I sleep, not because I lack things to do // neither am I drunk.</l>
          <l>It is because I have no worldly wealth // that I can sleep now.</l>
          <l>
            It is because I have gained great Dhamma wealth // that I can sleep
                                    peacefully.
          </l>
          <l>In my sleep // in every breathing in and breathing out</l>
          <l>There is benefit // nothing is lost.</l>
          <l>
            Awake, there are no doubtful thoughts; // there is nothing to fear in
                                    slumber.
          </l>
          <l>
            There are those that have troubles as if a poisoned arrow // has pierced
                                    their heart,
          </l>
          <l>afflicted with many sufferings and pains // if even those can sleep,</l>
          <l>Why should I who have pulled out the poisoned arrow // not find sleep?</l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          On hearing this, Māra thought: ‘The renunciant gotama knows my mind,’ and sad and
                              dejected he returned to his palace.
