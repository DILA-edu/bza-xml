          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have i heard, once, the Buddha was staying near rājagaha on gijjhakūṭa85
                              Mountain. at that time the Buddha was extolling the teaching of Nirvāṇa for the
                              monks.
        </p>
        <p>
          King Māra thought: ‘The Buddha is staying near rājagaha extolling the teaching
                              of Nirvāṇa for the monks. i should go and disturb them’. having thought this, he
                              changed into one-hundred people, fifty of which were extremely beautiful and
                              fifty extremely ugly. at that time the monks were all surprised and astonished.
                              ‘What is happening now? Such beauty, and again, such ugliness?’.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Buddha knew that Māra had come to disturb the gathering. at that time the
                              Buddha addressed Māra: 'In the long night of [saṃsāric] birth and rebirth,
                              you assume all these forms beautiful and ugly. How now do you attain deliverance
                              from the shore of suffering? What is the use of all these shape-changings? If
                              someone is attached to [the characteristics of] man or woman, you might [with
                              benefit] change into these forms. I, however, do not [give significance to] the
                              characteristics of a man or woman. What use is it changing into these
                              shapes?'
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said,
                              were happy and practised accordingly.
