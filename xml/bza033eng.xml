          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in
                              the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time the Buddha told the Bhikkhus: “Steadfastly maintaining the seven
                              practices , one is bound to be reborn as Sakka [the king of gods]. Why so? In
                              former times, when Sakka was a human he resolved to practice and indeed carried
                              out these practices : He was obedient to his parents and respectful to the
                              elders of the [extended clan-] family. His speech was gentle. He did not slander
                              others. He was generous, not stingy. He always told the truth, never betrayed
                              others. He did not let anger arise, and whenever he generated hatred, he strove
                              to extinguish it quickly.”
        </p>
        <p>At that time the World-honored One spoke a verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>
            [Whoever] towards one’s parents // displays filial obedience Towards one’s
                                    elders // heartfelt deep respect
          </l>
          <l>Always speaks gentle and friendly // kindly and good</l>
          <l>Cuts off slander // greed and hatred</l>
          <l>[of someone like this] the thirty three gods // have this to say:</l>
          <l>Such a practitioner // is our better</l>
          <l>He should dwell apart // as King of the Gods</l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said,
                              were happy and practised accordingly.
