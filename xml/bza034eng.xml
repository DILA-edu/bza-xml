          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have I heard once the Buddha was staying in the great hall at the shore of
                              the Monkey[lake] near Vesāli.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a Licchavi, with the name of Mahāli , who came to the Buddha, paid
                              homage to his feet and addressed him: “World-honered One, have you seen Sakka?”
        </p>
        <p>Buddha said: “ I have seen him.”</p>
        <p>
          The Licchavi addressed him: “There are yakkhas and demons that look like Sakka.
                              Might it be that the World-honored One has seen a yakkha or demon instead?”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Buddha told the Licchavi: “I am well acquainted with the Sakka’s appearance.
                              I also know that there are yakkhas, which look like Sakka. I also completely
                              know his original practice, the things he has done. When Sakka was a man, he was
                              obedient to his parents, he respected his elders, his speech was gentle, without
                              slander, he did away with avarice, always loved to give, he always spoke
                              truthfully, he did away with anger, did not give rise to hatred.”
        </p>
        <p>At that time the Buddha spoke a verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>
            [Whoever] towards one’s parents // displays filial obedience Towards one’s
                                    elders // heartfelt deep respect
          </l>
          <l>Always speaks gentle and friendly // kindly and good</l>
          <l>Cuts off slander // greed and hatred</l>
          <l>[of someone like this] the thirty three gods // have this to say:</l>
          <l>Such a practitioner // is our better</l>
          <l>He should dwell apart // as King of the Gods</l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said,
                              were happy and practised accordingly.
