          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in
                              the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time there was a monk, who approached, paid homage to his feet, stood to
                              one side and said to the Buddha: “World-honored One, where does the name ‘Sakka’
                              come from? What are the characteristics of ‘Sakka’?”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Buddha told the monk: “Originally when Sakka still was a human being, he
                              generously made offerings, led a pure life and his mind was faithful. With a
                              faithful mind he made offerings to the poor, the renunciants, the brahmins etc.
                              When he made offerings, he offered drinks and refreshments, all kinds of hard
                              and soft food, all kinds of garlands, all kinds of fragrance, incense, perfume,
                              bags, and bedding. Because of this reason the gods once called him Sakka.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Again the monk addressed the Buddha: “Why is Sakka called ‘Purindada’?” The
                              Buddha told the monk: “When Sakka in former times was born as a human being, he
                              made offerings without restraint. Again and again he made offerings, therefore
                              the gods called him by the name of ‘Purindada’ [He who gives repeatedly].”
        </p>
        <p>
          Again the monk addressed the Buddha: “And for what reason is Sakka also called
                              ‘Maghavā’?” The Buddha told the monk: “Sakka was originally a brahmin called
                              Maghavā.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Again [the monk] asked: “For what reason is he called ‘Vāsava’?” The Buddha said:
                              “Because again and again he offered clothes to renunciants and brahmins, for
                              that reason he was called ‘Vāsava’ [the Clother].”
        </p>
        <p>
          Again [the monk] asked: “For what reason is he called ‘Kosika?” The Buddha said:
                              “Because originally when Sakka was a man, his clan-name was ‘Kosika’. Therefore
                              he is called Kosika.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “And why is he called ‘Sujampati’?” The Buddha told the monk: “Sakka married
                              [Sujā] the daughter of the asura king Vepacitti, therefore he is known as
                              ‘Sujampati’ [Sujā’s husband].”
        </p>
        <p>
          “And why is he called ‘Thousand-Eyed?” The Buddha told the monk: “When Sakka was
                              a man, he was extremely intelligent. When it comes to settle things, he could
                              settle a thousand things in a short time. For that reason he is called ‘Thousand
                              Eyed’.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “And why is he called ‘Indra’?” The Buddha told the monk: “Sakka holds the
                              position of king of gods, he is in charge of their affairs, therefore he is
                              called ‘Indra’.”
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time the World-honored One said to the monks: “He was able to fulfill the
                              seven duties [mentioned] above, because of that, the other gods call him
                              ‘Sakka’.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said,
                              were happy and practised accordingly.
