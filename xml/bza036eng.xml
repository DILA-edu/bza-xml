          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in
                              the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time the World-honored One told the monks: “There once was a yakkha, he
                              was short, his face was ugly and his taint black. People did not like his sight.
                              [This yakkha now] seated himself on Sakka’s seat. When the thirty-three gods saw
                              the yakkha sitting on Sakka’s place, they all became very angry, and insulted
                              him in various ways. There, the ugly aspects of the yakkha slowly diminished, he
                              became attractive and grew taller. The gods abusing him became more and more
                              angry. The yakkha in turn grew even taller and more beautiful. The gods went to
                              Sakka and told him: “There is a yakkha, extremely ugly and short who sat in your
                              place. We the gods strongly abused him, and the yakkha’s form became beautiful,
                              his body grew taller!” Sakka said: “There is this yakkha, who on receiving abuse
                              turns beautiful, he is called Friend-of-men’s-anger. Thereupon Sakka went to his
                              seat, knelt with his cloth arranged over one shoulder, folded his hands, offered
                              incense and spoke to the yakkha: “Great seer! I am Sakka. I am Sakka.” Having
                              uttered his name thrice, the yakkha became small and ugly again and finally
                              vanished. Sakka resumed his seat and said to the gods: “From now on, let none of
                              you generate anger. If there is hostility, be carefully not to add to the
                              anger.” And he spoke this verse:
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>
            If someone comes and utters insults // let no one return these insults to
                                    him
          </l>
          <l>
            Towards him who came to attack and harm // let everyone generate loving
                                    kindness
          </l>
          <l>Those without anger, without violence // one should always befriend</l>
          <l>For they are nobles // they are the disciples of nobles</l>
          <l>
            Those who are angry, filled with hatred // are blocked by this mountain of
                                    anger
          </l>
          <l>If one at a time of anger and hate // can control oneself even a little</l>
          <l>This I call skilled // like the taming of a wicked horse</l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          The Buddha told the monks: “Sakka is the ruler of the gods, enjoying all kinds of
                              pleasure. If even he can control his anger, and praise those who control their
                              anger, how much more should you, oh monks, who, feeling that the family is not
                              family , went forth and persued the way, cut off you hair, and donned the robes,
                              how much more should you control anger and praise those who control their anger.
                              Thus, oh monks, you should practice!
        </p>
        <p>
          The monks, having listened to what the Buddha had said, were happy and practised
                              accordingly.
