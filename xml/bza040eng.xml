          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in
                              the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time the Buddha told the monks: “Long time ago Sakka Devānam Indo wanted
                              to go for a ride and enjoy his park land. He ordered his charioteer Mātali:
                              ‘Harness the thousand-horse chariot!’ Mātali promptly harnessed the chariot and
                              reported to Sakka: ‘The chariot is ready, [we may leave] whenever you please.’
                              Thereupon Sakka left the Vejayanta Palace, and facing east with folded hand paid
                              obeisance to the Buddha. When Mātali saw him paying obeisance facing east, his
                              mind was filled with fear, and he dropped whip and reigns. Sakka said: ‘What
                              have you seen that scared you so that you drop whip and reigns?’ Mātali said:
                              ‘Maghavā! Husband of Suja! I drop whip and reigns because of the fear that arose
                              in my mind when I saw you paying obeisance facing east with folded hands. All
                              beings revere you; all the kings are completely under your rule. The four
                              [Guardian] kings and the thirty-three gods, all respectfully revere you. Who
                              then surpasses you in power, that you stand and pay obeisance with folded hands
                              facing east?’ Sakka answered: ‘Everybody reveres me, that might indeed be as you
                              say. [However,] what all devas and human beings respectfully venerate is the one
                              called Buddha. To him respectfully I pay obeisance.’ That time Sakka spoke this
                              verse:
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>The teacher of the world of perfect name // for him, Mātali, you should know,</l>
          <l>
            I have engendered great respect and faith // and therefore pay obeisance with
                                    folded hands.
          </l>
        </lg>
        <p>Mātali said this verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>
            [Now that you] thus venerate the best in the world // I too will follow you
                                    in worshipping him
          </l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          Having said this [they/he?] paid obeisance with folded hands, mounted the chariot
                              and went.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Buddha told the monks: “Sakka is powerful, the king of the gods. If he
                              venerates and pays obeisance to the Buddha, how much more diligently should you,
                              oh bhikkhus, who have taken tonsure and left home to study the way, venerate the
                              Buddha, like it is fitting for a monk.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said,
                              were happy and practiced accordingly.
