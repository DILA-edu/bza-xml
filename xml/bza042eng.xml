          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in
                              the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time the Buddha told the bhikkhus: “Long time ago Sakka Devānam Indo
                              wanted to go for a ride and enjoy his park land. He ordered his charioteer
                              Mātali: ‘Harness the thousand-horse chariot!’ Soon Mātali had harnessed the
                              chariot, went to Sakka, and said to him: ‘The chariot is ready, we may leave
                              whenever you please.’ Thereupon Sakka left the Vejayanta Palace and with folded
                              hands paid obeisance facing west. When Mātali saw this, he generated surprise
                              and fear, and dropped whip and reigns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sakka said: ‘What have you seen that you are so scared?’ Mātali said: ‘Maghavā!
                              Husband of Suja! When I saw you with folded hands paying obeisance facing west,
                              my mind became filled with fear and I dropped whip and reigns. All beings revere
                              you; all the kings are completely under your rule. The four [Guardian] kings and
                              the thirty-three gods, all respectfully revere you. Who then surpasses you in
                              power, that you stand and pay obeisance with folded hands facing west?’ Sakka
                              answered: ‘Everybody reveres me, like you say. [However,] what all devas and
                              human beings respectfully venerate is the Sangha. I respectfully pay obeisance
                              to the Sangha.’
        </p>
        <p>Thereupon Mātali spoke a verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>
            The human body is filled with pus and sweat // entangled within a feeble
                                    corpse
          </l>
          <l>
            Always afflicted by hunger and thirst // why do you admire these homeless
                                    ones
          </l>
          <l>Why do you // venerate them deeply</l>
          <l>What beauty do they have // and what virtue</l>
          <l>Please tell me // I would like to know</l>
        </lg>
        <p>At that time Sakka Devānam Indo spoke a verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>Right because they are homeless // I do admire them</l>
          <l>They own no goods // no storehouse and no grain.</l>
          <l>
            They have left all tasks and business // frugally live out their lives in
                                    harmony
          </l>
          <l>They keep the precepts well // discuss the wonderful Dhamma</l>
          <l>brave and firm they are without fear // practicing noble silence.</l>
          <l>devas and asuras // fight incessantly</l>
          <l>and among men // each harbors anger.</l>
          <l>I venerate those // who have abandoned blade and cudgel.</l>
          <l>Everybody strives to accumulate [riches], // they let go of everything.</l>
          <l>What the world holds dear, // their mind has discarded.</l>
          <l>I pay obedience to those // who have abandoned all extremes.</l>
          <l>This, Mātali, // you should know.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>At that time Mātali spoke this verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>You venerate the very best // I will follow you in worship</l>
          <l>What the Maghavā venerates // I too shall venerate</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Having spoken this verse, Sakka mounted the chariot and left.</p>
        <p>
          Buddha told the monks: “Sakka is powerful among men and devas, if even he
                              venerates the Sangha, how much more should you, oh monks, who have left home to
                              study the way, venerate the Sangha.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said,
                              were happy and practiced accordingly.
