          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in
                              the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time there was a nun called Āḷavikā. One early morning she took her robes
                              and her begging bowl and entered the town to beg for food. Having finished her
                              meal, she cleaned her bowl, and decided to enter the Andhavana forest [to
                              meditate].
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time King Māra the Bad thought: “Gotamo the renunciant is now staying at
                              Sāvatthī in the Andhavana forest. His disciple the nun Āḷavikā entered the town
                              [Sāvatthī] to beg for food. Having finished her meal and cleaned her bowl, she
                              has gathered her seat and wants to enter this forest. I shall disturb her!”
                              Thereupon the Bad One turned into a young man, standing at the wayside he asked
                              Āḷavikā: “Where are you going?” The nun answered: “I am going to a secluded
                              place.” On hearing this the young man spoke a verse:
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>In all the worlds // there is no liberation</l>
          <l>You are going to a secluded, quiet place // for what</l>
          <l>
            You are still young and pretty // if you won’t enjoy the five sensual
                                    pleasures [now]
          </l>
          <l>One day you will be old and weak // don’t have regrets later</l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          There the nun thought: “Who is this, who wants to disturb me? What a cheat ! Is
                              he a human or a non-human being?” Having thought this, she entered concentration
                              and, using her insight, she recognized that it was the Bad One who tried to
                              disturb her. She spoke a verse:
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>There is liberation in the world // I know this through experience</l>
          <l>You, Bad One, ignorant and shallow // do not know its traces</l>
          <l>
            Pleasure is like a sharp halberd, slashing // the aggregates are bandits,
                                    running after you knife in hand
          </l>
          <l>
            You talk of enjoying the five sensual pleasures // but the suffering [caused
                                    by] pleasure is to be feared
          </l>
          <l>Pleasure causes sadness and troubles, // pleasure causes longing.</l>
          <l>
            Pleasure causes hundredfold suffering, // pleasure is the root of all
                                    suffering.
          </l>
          <l>[I have] cut off all craving // the darkness of ignorance destroyed</l>
          <l>
            Having reached and witnessed complete cessation // [I] dwell in a state of
                                    purity
          </l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          At that time the Bad One thought: “The nun Āḷavikā knows my mind well!” Vexed,
                              dispirited, and ashamed he returned to his palace.
