          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in
                              the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time the nun Somā took her robes and her begging bowl and entered
                              Sāvatthī to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl,
                              gathered her seat [for meditation] and went to the Andhavana forest [to
                              meditate].
        </p>
        <p>
          King Māra the Bad thought: “The nun Somā took her robes and her begging bowl and
                              entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she has cleaned her
                              bowl, and gathered her seat [for meditation] and is now on her way to the
                              Andhavana forest [to meditate].” Upon this the Bad One changed into a Brahmin,
                              stood at the wayside and said: “My lady , where are you going?” The nun
                              answered: “I am going to a secluded place.” Thereupon the Bad One spoke a verse:
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>The stage which seers attain // that state is difficult to reach</l>
          <l>With your inferior intelligence // you cannot attain that state</l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          Thereupon the nun thought: “Is this a human or a non-human being, who wants to
                              disturb me?” She entered concentration and, using her insight , she recognized
                              that it was the Bad One. She spoke a verse:
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>
            The mark of womanhood has nothing to do with it // if only the mind practices
                                    meditative concentration
          </l>
          <l>
            And perceives the highest Dhamma; // as long as there are the marks of man-
                                    and womanhood
          </l>
          <l>One can say that women // are not apt for the Dhamma;</l>
          <l>
            Once the marks of man- and womanhood are no more // from where should
                                    distinctions arise
          </l>
          <l>[I have] cut off all craving // the darkness of ignorance destroyed</l>
          <l>
            Pleasure causes hundredfold suffering, // pleasure is the root of all
                                    suffering.
          </l>
          <l>[I have] cut off all craving // the darkness of ignorance destroyed</l>
          <l>
            Having reached and witnessed complete cessation // [I] dwell in a state of
                                    purity
          </l>
          <l>Therefore understand // Bad One you are defeated</l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          At that time the Bad One thought: “The nun Somā knows my mind well!” Depressed,
                              dispirited, and ashamed he returned to his palace.
