          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in
                              the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time the nun Kisāgotamī took her robes and her begging bowl and entered
                              the town [Sāvatthī] to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her
                              bowl, gathered her seat [for meditation], went to go to the Andhavana forest,
                              sat under a tree, abiding in [jhāna] meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time King Māra the Bad thought: “The renunciant Gotama is staying at
                              Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park and here is this nun called
                              Kisāgotamī. She took her robes and her begging bowl and entered Sāvatthī to beg
                              for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, gathered her seat [for
                              meditation], and went to go to the Andhavana forest, [now] she has sat down
                              under a tree and is abiding in [jhāna] meditation.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thought this he changed into a young man, and with the intention to
                              disturb her, spoke this verse:
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>What are you doing there now // sitting sadly under a tree</l>
          <l>Sighing and sobbing // haven’t you lost a child?</l>
          <l>Dwelling alone in the forest // aren’t you looking for a man?</l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          There the nun thought: “Who is this? What a cheat! Is he, who wants to cause
                              confusion in me, a human or a non-human being?” She entered concentration and
                              recognized that it was King Māra. She spoke a verse:
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>I have cut off craving // I am without desire, do not think about children</l>
          <l>Sitting upright among the trees // no worries no agitations trouble me</l>
          <l>[I have] cut off all craving // the darkness of ignorance destroyed</l>
          <l>
            Having reached complete cessation // [I] peacefully dwell in a state of
                                    purity
          </l>
          <l>Therefore understand // Bad One you are defeated</l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          At that time the Bad One thought: “The nun Kisāgotamī knows my mind well!”
                              Depressed, dispirited, and ashamed he returned to his palace.
