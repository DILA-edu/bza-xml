          This file has been created in the project "A Digital Comparative Edition of the Bieyi
                          za ahan jing" conducted at the Chung-hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies 中華佛學研究所 and
                          the Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教研修學院. The project was funded by the Chiang
                          Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange 蔣經國國際學術交流基金會. The aim of
                          the project was to produce a comparative digital edition and partial translation of
                          the 364 sutras of the BZA and their parallels. In the original interface, the texts were kept in
                          an eXist database and are realized via XQuery and XSLT as HTML for the online user.
                          The project lasted from 2005-2009.

          Thus have I heard, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in
                              the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time there was a nun called Upacālā staying in the Rājakārāma Vihāra. One
                              morning she took her robes and her begging bowl and entered Sāvatthī to beg for
                              food. Having finished the alms , she cleaned her bowl, washed her feet, gathered
                              her seat [for meditation]. She went to the Andhavana forest, sat uprightly under
                              a tree, and entered [jhāna] meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time King Māra thought: “These days Gotama the renunciant is staying at
                              Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park. Here now is this nun
                              called Upacālā, who in the morning took her robes and her begging bowl and
                              entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she washed her feet,
                              gathered her seat and went to the Andhavana forest. [Now] she is sitting
                              uprightly under a tree, having entered [jhāna] meditation. I shall go and
                              disturb her!” Having thought thus he changed into a young man, approached her
                              and said: “My lady! In which place do you want to be reincarnated?” The nun
                              answered: “I will not be reincarnated anywhere.” That time the young man said a
                              verse:
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>The Tāvatiṃsa and the Yama heaven // the Tusita, the Nimmānarati</l>
          <l>
            And the heaven Paranimmitavasavattin // are realms of great happiness and
                                    pleasure
          </l>
          <l>You should vow to enjoy them // and you will be reborn there as desired</l>
        </lg>
        <p>The nun Upacālā said a verse:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>The Tāvatiṃsa and the Yama heaven // the Tusita, the Nimmānarati</l>
          <l>
            And the heaven Paranimmitavasavattin // [those] in these places experience
                                    pleasures [but]
          </l>
          <l>
            As long as there is no emancipation from the view of self // they are [still]
                                    bound by Māra
          </l>
          <l>All worlds are moving, are in flux // these too will change and vanish</l>
          <l>The common person can not // escape from Māra’s realm</l>
          <l>All worlds are on fire // smoke streaming out from all of them</l>
          <l>Away from the tremors // that place I enjoy</l>
          <l>I have cut off all craving // the darkness of ignorance destroyed</l>
          <l>
            Having reached complete cessation // [I] peacefully dwell in a state of
                                    purity
          </l>
          <l>Therefore understand // Bad One you are defeated</l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          At that time King Māra thought: “This nun knows my mind well!” Depressed,
                              dispirited, and ashamed he returned to his palace.
